MultiQC is a modular tool to aggregate results from bioinformatics analyses across many samples into a single report, a MultiQC report is usually composed of the following:
1) General Statistics which is an overlook of the following:
* Percentage of duplicate reads
* Average percentage of GC content
* Average sequence length
* Percentage of modules failed in FastQC report including those not plotted
* Total sequences in millions

2) FastQC which is quality control tool for high throughput sequence data, written by Simon Andrews at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge. The Sequence Counts diagram contains sequence counts for each sample.
* Note: Duplicate read counts are an estimate only

3) Sequence Quality Histograms which shows the mean quality value across each base position in the read.
* Note: Red region (Phred Score from 0-20) represents poor sequence quality

4) Per Sequence Quality Scores
* Note: The number of reads with average quality scores. Shows if a subset of reads has poor quality.

5) Per Base Sequence Content which shows the proportion of each base position for which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called.

6) Per Sequence GC Content which is the average GC content of reads. Normal random library typically have a roughly normal distribution of GC content.

7) Per Base N Content which is the the percentage of base calls at each position for which an N was called.

8) Sequence Length Distribution

9) Sequence Duplication Levels which is the relative level of duplication found for every sequence

10) Overrepresented sequences which is the total amount of overrepresented sequences found in each library.

11) Adapter Content which is the cumulative percentage count of the proportion of your library which has seen each of the adapter sequences at each position.
* Note: Adapter Content diagram is extremely important at showing us what type of adapters are being used and whether it's necessary to trim them for better quality of data.

12) Status Checks which is a diagram that shows status for each FastQC section showing whether results seem entirely normal (green), slightly abnormal (orange) or very unusual (red).

In this MultiQC file, MultiQC reports regarding SRA experimental data are being listed along with my interpretation.
