# Work

This repository is for my undergraduate bioinformatics research with Dr. Albert. Please feel free to make any modifications. 

The goal of this project is for us to explore genome sequence alignmet and analyze data quality mainly via SRA (Short Read Archive) data. 
Plasmodium-specific accession numbers we are using here are mainly from Dr. Lindner's paper which are published on NCBI.
